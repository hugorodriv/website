                My name is Hugo. I was born in 2003. I am in the last year of my Bachelor's in Computer Science and
                Engineering in UPF Barcelona.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ever since I can remember, I have always loved tinkering with and exploring computing in general. The
                first big project I undertook was modifying the operating system of my Android phone when I was 10 years
                old, as the stock one was too limited.

                <br>
                To do so, I had to learn basic hardware functions, how an operating system works, what a kernel is, and
                how to use the command line.

                I did this almost weekly for a long time, and thatâ€™s when I decided to dedicate my professional life to
                this field.

                <br>
                <br>
                More than 10 years later, I still continue digging deeper into how computers work. This is one of the
                main reasons I like Linux and other OSS tools and projects, as they allow us to better understand the
                tools we use every day and expand our computing knowledge.
                <br>
                <br>
                Nowadays, I use Arch Linux whenever I can, and I prefer CLI tools since they are much faster and more
                efficient than GUI-based ones. I use <i>NVIM</i>, <i>TMUX</i>, and other tools for everything that
                involves working with code.
                <br>
                <a class="text-blue-500 font-bold underline" href="https://github.com/hugorodriv/dotConfig">Dotfiles</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                I enjoy working on the backend the most, and I strive to write code that is as efficient, readable,
                maintainable, and elegant as possible.

                This is my personal website in which I will host some of personal projects that I am working on to
                learn/practice some concepts in my free time.

                It uses basic HTML with the TailwindCSS library to manage the style
