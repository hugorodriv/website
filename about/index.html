            I'm Hugo and I've been coding for almost 10 years. <br>

        <p class="pt-10 text-white text-3xl font-bold font-sans">About this website</p>
        <p class="pt-6 leading-9 text-gray-200 text-xl font-sans">
            Welcome to my personal website! I will use it to host and showcase various projects, as well as a sort of digital CV.
            <br>
            <br>
            The website is programmed directly in HTML and uses TailwindCSS for managing the styling.
            <br>
            I manage the hosting myself in a VPS running Debian that uses NGINX for serving the content.
            <br>
            <br>
            Each project listed will have a description on how it works more technically, as well as a direct link to the GitHub repository.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of the projects are built using tools not necessary for the example in question, the point being for me to learn such tools for when they are actually needed, and to showcase my learning process aswell as the final product.
