                <p>This project started as a weekend project; the idea was to take a picture of the family cat going
                    in and out of the house through the cat door.</p>

                <p>For the camera I originally thought of buying a PiCam, but that would also require a
                    Raspberry sitting outside and I would need to somehow make everything waterproof, so I went in
                    another direction.</p>

                <p>I decided to use an old Android phone acting as an IP Camera (there are many apps for precisely
                    this, I settled for <a class="text-blue-500"
                        href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en">this one.</a><br />
                    Water proofing this would be much simpler as the phone by itself already is waterproof (to a
                    degree), I just needed to connect it to electricity for continuous streaming.</p>

                <p>For the backend I decided to go with a Raspberry Pi 4 I already had running with other services,
                    the only constraint would be that I needed to develop an algorithm that would not take too many
                    resources.</p>

                <p>So, I needed to figure out a way to process these photos, somehow detect when a movement
                    happened, and send this picture to my phone for ease of viewing.</p>

                <h1></h1>

                <br>
                <h1>Capturing and fetching images</h1>

                <p>The android applications provides a frontend HTTP configuration interface, as well as some
                    endpoints, one of them being for taking a still photo.</p>

                <p>It offers transit encryption through HTTPS and password protection. This was not strictly needed
                    as the images only travel through the local network, but I enabled it to be on the safe
                    side.<br />
                    The Python code to fetch the images is fairly simple, with the only observation being that the
                    certificate is not verified as it is self-signed by the android application:</p>


                <p class="border !w-fit p-3">
                    <code>def getImage(): <br>
                        response = requests.get(secrets.ENDPOINT, auth=(secrets.USERNAME, secrets.PASSWORD), <br>
                        verify=False)<br>
                        if response.status_code == 200: <br>
                        return Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))
                    </code>
                </p>
                <em>
                    <p>(simplified code)</p>
                </em>


                <br>
                <h1>Main Loop</h1>

                <p>The program consists of a <em>while</em> loop that runs forever. It starts by taking a picture
                    and comparing it with the one taken just before. If the difference score suprasses a threshold,
                    then it takes some more pictures consecutively, creates a GIF animation and sends them using the
                    Telegram API</p>

                <br>
                <h1>OpenCV: Detection Algorithms</h1>

                <p>To detect when a movement in front of the camera happened I decided to use OpenCV for its
                    simplicity and good integration with Python.</p>

                <p>At first I developed a very single algorithm that took the two images, downscaled them and
                    effectively calculated the sum of the differences, pixel by pixel.</p>

                <p>This algorithm worked well but it was highly sensitive to changes in lightning. Setting the
                    threshold very high to try to compensate for this would result in “False Negatives” (movement
                    not being detected)</p>

                <p>My second approach was to try a more complex approach in which different operations to remove
                    noise, fill in small gaps and detect shape contour movement were performed to the
                    <em>difference</em> image.
                </p>

                <p>This resulted in much better detections. With the threshold set to 5% I got almost no False
                    Positives and 0 False Negatives.</p>

                <p>I was expecting to expand on this by further processing the images to remove shadows and
                    different lightning artifacts, but this was not necessary and would add extra complexity and
                    resource utilization.</p>

                <p>I also did consider implementing a pre-trained ML model for object recognition, but again this
                    didn’t end up being needed and would have required much more resource utilization.</p>

                <br>
                <h1>Telegram</h1>

                <p>After having a movement detected and the GIF composed of the images leading to that detection, as
                    well as some after the fact, this GIF is then sent to a telegram group Chat through the API.</p>

                <p>The code consists of an async function that shares the GIF to a given group chat. The secrets are
                    stored in a <strong>secrets.py</strong> file, of which there is a template in the github repo,
                    for reference</p>

                <br>
                <h1>Docker</h1>

                <p>Once I had the script working and I checked the messages were delivered correctly, I decided to
                    Dockerize the whole thing for better management, as the rest of the services on this Raspberry
                    Pi already run in Docker.</p>


                <p>Building the Docker image took quite a bit of time, as some dependencies (Numpy and OpenCV
                    especially) were quite heavy, and I decided to compile from source to have the most optimized
                    version possible.</p>

                <p>Once the Docker image was created, I transferred this Image to my Raspberry Pi and I ran it</p>

                <p class="border !w-fit p-3">
                    <code>docker load &lt;./guntercam_v2.tar <br>
                        docker run -it -d --name guntercam --restart unless-stopped</code>
                </p>

                <br>

                <br>
                <h1>Results</h1>

                <p>The system is quite robust as a whole. The only problem is that sometimes the Image grabber does
                    return a non complete image, probably due to some sort of network error or lost packet.</p>

                <p>This was easily fixed with discarding this image and continuing the execution. This happens
                    fairly rarely, so I was not too concerned about it.</p>

                <p>Overall, the performance impact on my Rpi is fairly tolerable (\~60% of continuous use on one of
                    the four CPU cores), which allows the rest of the services to run with no problems whatsoever.
